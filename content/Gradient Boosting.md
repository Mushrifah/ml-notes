# Gradient Boosting:

- F(x) = [sum i=0 to n]alpha(i)DT(i)(x)  
- basically its a combinationÂ  of sequential number of decision tree with each given input as the data and output as the previous residuals to predict.  
- It has a learning rate associated which helps avoid overfitting to get to the result.
